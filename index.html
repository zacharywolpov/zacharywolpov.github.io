  <p>This is a recent photo of my cat, Mochi! My other cat is named 
    Oreo, and a photo of him will be uploaded shortly! Stay tuned! Both 
    cats are about 3 and a half years old. They love to play with each 
    other, and sit by the window ready to pounce on any birds or squirrels
    that come by!</p>
